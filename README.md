# F21DL-G6

### Week 1 - Introduction
 - Got introduced to the team members as well as the lab supervisor.
 - Decided on a dataset to start working on for the lab excercises.
 - We decided on using a dataset for the top 2000 universities in the world 
   (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/batrosjamali/top-2000-universities-of-the-world)
 - We decided to use thi dataset as it had a sizeable amount of attributes and features that we could 
   use to train and test the dataset.
   
### Week 2 - Binning and Normalisation
 - We pre-processed the data and found a solution to remove placeholders that were there in place of
   missing data
 - We normalised the data provided to give us a more workable form for the data.
 - Using this we created visualisations of our data that we could use to extrapolate basic information
   about our dataset.
   
### Week 3/4 - Getting started with Scikit-Learn
 - We found out after removing all records that contained missing data we were left with only 161 instances.
 - After discussing with our lab supervisor we found this to be too few data instances to work with and hence had
   look for a new dataset to work with.
 - We found a dataset that tracks the performance of students from 2 Portuguese schools (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/student-performance)
 - We picked this dataset as it has no missing values and is very sizeable.
